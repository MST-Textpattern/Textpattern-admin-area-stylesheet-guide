h1. Textpattern CMS admin area stylesheet guide (v4.5)

The purpose of this guide is to audit and document the current UI elements used within the admin-side of "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com in order to streamline development, avoid conflicts and inconsistencies, and as a reference for admin theme authors and plugin authors.

h2. Global ID selectors

h3. #messagepane

h4. Usage:

Displaying alert messages above @div.txp-container@. The child @span@ can have a @class="error"@ or @class="warning"@ or @class="success"@ depending on the context of the message.

h4. Current code structure example:

bc. <div id="messagepane">
  <span id='message' class='success'>File <strong>test-file.zip</strong> updated.</span>
</div>

h4. Notes:

# @id="message"@ on the child @span@ does not seem to be used for styling purposes. Need clarification of its use.
# This method is not currently consistent - it is not implemented on the login pages (login, logout, password request).

h3. #edit

Needs auditing and further clarification - seems to be used inconsistently throughout the admin pages. Could easily be replaced by proper use and targeting of the @.edit-pane@ class instead (see below).

h3. #list

Needs auditing and further clarification - seems to be used inconsistently throughout the admin pages. Could easily be replaced by proper use and targeting of the @.list@ class instead (see below).

h3. #content_switcher

h4. Usage:

Used on a page with a list of switchable content, for example the list of available page templates within 'pages' page.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      ...
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      ...
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
      <th scope="row"></th>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      ...
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
      <th scope="row"></th>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      ...
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

h4. Notes:

# The attributes @cellpadding@, @cellspacing@, @border@, @align@ and @width@ are unnecessary and can (and should) be styled with CSS instead.
# A @scope@ attribute should be applied to cells where appropriate (accessibility).
# Removal of @id="list"@, as it duplicates functionality of @class="list"@.
