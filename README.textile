h1. Textpattern CMS admin area stylesheet guide (v4.5)

The purpose of this guide is to document the current UI elements used within the admin-side of "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com in order to streamline development, avoid conflicts and inconsistencies, and as a reference for admin theme authors and plugin authors.

h2. Global ID selectors

h3. #messagepane

h4. Usage:

Displaying alert messages above @div.txp-container@. The child @span@ can have a @class="error"@ or @class="warning"@ or @class="success"@ depending on the context of the message.

h4. Code structure example:

bc. <div id="messagepane">
  <span id='message' class='success'>File <strong>test-file.zip</strong> updated.</span>
</div>

h4. Notes:

# @id="message"@ on the child @span@ does not seem to be used for styling purposes. Need clarification of its use.
# This method is not currently consistent - it is not implemented on the login pages (login, logout, password request).

h3. #edit

Needs auditing and further clarification - seems to be used inconsistently throughout the admin pages. Could easily be replaced by proper use and targeting of the @.edit-pane@ class instead (see below).

h3. #list

Needs auditing and further clarification - seems to be used inconsistently throughout the admin pages. Could easily be replaced by proper use and targeting of the @.list@ class or @.txp-list@ class instead (see below).
